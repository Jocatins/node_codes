INTRODUCTION:

Meeting commenced at the newly scheduled time (exactly 4:05pm) with MD presiding. He welcomed everyone and urged that we present our reports as smart as possible to manage the time we have. He also quickly informed that he would be initiating another meeting that will occur monthy or forthnightly and those that will be part of that meeting will be adequately notified.

 

REVIEW/ADOPTION OF MINUTES OF THE LAST MEETING:

A good number of staff signified that they have read the minutes of the last meeting, hence necessary observations were made. For instance, fig 7.1.2 had to be expunged while figs. 7.1.5, 7.1.6, 9.0.8, 9.1.1 were also corrected. Onochie’s observation on fig 11.0.2 could not be established as MD himself recalled and clarified that he undeniably made the statement. After the corrections, the motion to adopt the minute was moved by Wole Adetiba and this was seconded by Vince Okeke. However, Wole suggested that Dayo drops a copy of the minute on the WhatsApp group like he did previously. He opined that it will be more accessible to everone that way and ultimately it will allow us to manage the 1-hour meeting efficiently. MD had reservations for the use of WhatsApp group for official matters, he advised that we send all corrections via e-mail.

 

MAJOR DEPARTMENTAL UNIT UPDATES

Find below the summaries of activities as presented by the respresentatives of each department:

 

ADMINISTRATION AND FINANCE

Ken represented Admin and Finance; his report is as follows:

Admin/HR Task  

Ken stated that he went to FIRS office in Marina to rectify an online error generated (filling issue). He couldn't file VAT return because of the issue. He was asked to come to their office having complained about it. However, it was fixed and he was now able to file the return. Every transctions and other tax related activities of the FIRS are now doable online. 

 

Ken reported that Mr.Owolabi brought Teqbridge’s audited account and they had a brief meeting on tax related issues. He mentioned that he went to LIRS for PAYE and Pension contribution. He went to Mbanugo's office as well to sign the audited account.

 

On HMO, Ken informed that our health care service with Axa Mansard has expired and they have sent us an invoice of 35% increase in their premium. He discussed with the account officer who said the reason for the upward review was that some hospitals had upgraded to higher plans due to increased hospital tariff. Another reason  they gave as the cause is the company's current claims ratio as well as medical inflation. 

 

Finance/Transaction

Ken posted some transactions and also had to be in the bank for some transactions. He was able to complete the Company Income Tax Schedule form and send to Owolabi for rectification, afterwards it will be submitted and then we can apply for tax clearance. 

 

BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT

Dayo presented for Business Development; his report is as follows:

 

PROVIDUS BANK

Dayo reported that following the inspection and quote sent to Providus for their Access Control (doors), a representative of the internal audit unit of Providus called to review the quote (price). This was done and sent back to them. They promised to get back as soon as possible.

Osun State

On Osun state, Dayo reported that Tobi (adhoc) and himself did a follow up on the Commissioner (Hon. Babatunde Olawale), he is yet to revert on the questionnaire, but promised it will be sent to us as soon as it is completed.

 

 

 

 

 

REGISTRY

Vince reported for Registry. His report is as follows:

 

Indexing and Scanning

Vince reported that Indexing, Scanning, and QA of the property files are progressing (1,149 Indexed for the week but we scanned (949) backlog and QA-ed (1,092) which we have returned to Lands) with the Total in the system at 76,497.

 

Vince informed that Lands Bureau is still sorting more files into their Root Title relationship with the available files and they have collected 97,0416 files in total (with 568 for the week). About 1,690 files were returned back to Lands Bureau this week.  

 

Backlog of Scanning for Registry Files

The registry department assigned all Indexers (10) and scanners (17), and QA (11) according to their normal work process. Currently, we have over 5000+ files yet to be indexed, as a result of the need to clear all Backlog of scanning, with other files categories as shown below:

§     3253:  LSDPC files awaiting clarifications from LSDPC and also Aumentum issues

§     4656:  PSDP files awaiting clarifications from Lands and also Aumentum issues

§     4056:  Village Excision that could not be Lodged on Aumentum because of Aumentum issues

§     5,118: Private CofO folders not yet captured

Note that we have captured multiple Assignments of Part, which creates additional Property which increases the number of files in the system, as against what Lands delivered to us. Thus this accounts for the difference.

 

UAT on Governor's Consent

Vince informed that testing is still ongoing on the release 5.2.4.957 and it is expected to be suitable for Go-Live. Please note, that not all the UAT issues were resolved in this release, only the Process Blockers were resolved.

 

JIRA Issues:

Discussion continued with Mark on other issues in Jira, according to Vince, especially with the observation from testing and UAT of the new Release 5.2.4.

 

End-User Training on Allocation of State Land Transaction and Governor's Conse

The End User training on Governor’s Consent, Search, CTC, OSSG Land Information, and OSSG Charting Information transactions, has been concluded and Hands-on practice is in process.

A Whatsapp Group is being used to follow up on the trainees. No trainees for Allocation of State Land or Governor's Consent practiced during the week, except PS Lands that was involved in the Simulation. The management of Lands and OSSG should implore their staff to practice.

 

Migration of Release 5.2.4.957 to Production Environment

Vince reported that they have fully migrated all Registry System data and Applications to the Production Server with the latest Aumentum Release 5.2.4.957, and have notified the Cadastre and Software team, to initiate other necessary Aumentum upgrades, reports, and fee syncing. They have also prepared the draft components of the Deployment Plan Document, which was forwarded to Lagos/PwC having completed the migration to the Production Server.

These documents were printed and forwarded to PwC for signing last week. Feedback is still being awaited as of June 25, 2021. The full migration to the Production Server is predicated on the sign-off of the DAS documents.

 

Go-Live Simulation on AoSL and GVCT Transaction

The Go-Live simulation for the Allocation State Land and Governor’s Consent transactions, which started in the week of May 18, 2021, is yet to be concluded as of June 25, 2021. PwC is following up with Lagos State personnel, with the hope of completing it before June 28, 2021.

System configuration is concurrently ongoing with the data analysis. Also, preparation for the next phase of discussions and third-party integration is being planned.

 

 

Backup Protocol

On backup, Vince reported that they saw MoST using a similar manual type of backup. He informed that he had a meeting with Ikem, so we can have our own backup. This may require us (Teqbridge) to procure an External Hard Drive.

MoST reported the continuation of the backup process for the Aumentum Solution and will provide the Backup Plan documentation for the Aumentum solution by next week. The registry team also had a meeting with the MoST ICT team on June 22, 2021, to review the Backup process suitability and will finalize the process before June 28, 2021. Note that, the Temporary Storage space (10TB) provided by MoST on a Server in ABAT is no longer accessible, thus we cannot continues the usual manual backup, every Friday of the week, and hope to resolve this as stated above.

We requested these items in Jan 2021 and have followed up with additional reminders. Though few of the request has been delivered, however, some of the most important items (Stapler Pin, A4 Paper, Ropes, etc) are yet to be supplied as of June 25, 2021.

 

Server Access and Network Issues:

The LAN network was relatively okay this week likewise the internet though it fluctuated during the peak period (10am to 4pm). This requires a very urgent review, to resolving it permanently.

Session ended due to technical reason on IST part. The only task left is to setup COCIS to start as Windows Service.

 

COCIS Support. The software team decided not to escalate this issues yet, pending the completion of the successful COCIS Installation the day before. The intention is to use the completion as more leverage during our escalation. However, A gentle reminder was sent in to the responsible staff.

 

One Chijoke in the support/Procurement department claimed not to be aware of COCIS in Total. He suggests we officially re-introduce the company (Teqbridge Limited) and our various activities with Total.

 

MD said Onochie seem to have answered the question he had in mind. However, he  wondered how a whole department like that in Total would say they are not aware of the contract Teqbridge has had with Total for this long. Sounds so unbelievable.

 

MD informed that he tried the “Tawk BOT” and it seem its not yet configured for use as he didn’t get any response. Nicholas however confirmed he got the messge MD sent via the chat, although he did not respond

 

 

AOB:

MD asked Wole to send a reminder today.

 

Vince suggested we adopt email/skype and mandate everyone to pass their comment whether okay or not

 

MD advised we send our reports on Friday to facilitate how the minute is being drafted.

 

Ken once again mentioned the increment from AXA Mansard (35%), MD, Onochie, Ofem commented. MD immediately mandated Ken to select a team from amongst us to have a meeting with the representatives of Axa Mansard, with a view to understand the rationale for this 35% increase and know if we can still continue with them.

Ken  is to officially communicate the details about the new rate to all staff via email.

 

As usual, MD reminded everyone about COVID-19 and implore us to try and get the vaccine. He informed that the 2nd JAB is now available for those who got the 1st, while those who are yet to be vaccinated are encouraged to watch out for their 1st JAB in August.
